          Chapter 6 explains that even when we choose how we present ourselves online, there is also a second version of us being built through tracking. Companies, governments, and apps collect our clicks, locations, searches, and habits to create profiles about us. Most of the time, we do not get to see these profiles or control how they are used. Rettberg connects this idea to the panopticon, meaning people change how they act when they feel watched. Today, that feeling can come from social media, school systems, workplaces, and even phones.

          The chapter also shows how photos can be used for power. Images can help someone share their life, but they can also be taken without permission or used in unfair ways, like mugshots or identity checks. Overall, the chapter focuses on how tracking shapes our choices and our identity, even when we are not fully aware of it.
